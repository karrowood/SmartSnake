# SmartSnake

SmartSnake is a web application I built using HTML/CSS and TypeScript.

I built this application based on the famous snake game. I have previously built my own version of that game.
Once day I was thinking about how long the snake could go if the computer played it. This sparked my interest in
creating SmartSnake.

I created four different algorithms that the snake can use to see how long it will go until it dies. Some of the algorithms
are better than others. I also created it to where the user can mess around with the size of the play area and the speed that
the snake will go. Even at the highest speed, some of the algorithms will seem slow when the game area is large.

When creating this web app I used some CSS from freefrontend.com to make my app look better.
